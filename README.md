# Development

## Installation
Run `npm ci` to install dependencies.

## Local build
Run `npm start` to start development server.

Copy absolute disk path to `dist/index-dev.user.js` and paste it into URL of your browser.
It should be similar to `D:\Repositories\Stuff-unlocked\dist\index-dev.user.js`.
This will install the script in Tampermonkey.

You will have to disable production script, so that only the DEV one is active.

Now everytime you make a change in the code, the erepublik page should refresh automatically.

## Production build
Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Old stuff
The old (non-React) version of the script is in `src/old-index.user.js`.
It is appended during a build phase to `index.user.js` file.
In result the `index.user.js` file contains both old and new version of the script.

`index.user.js` = `src/userscript-header.js` + `src/old-index.user.js` + React build artifacts.
